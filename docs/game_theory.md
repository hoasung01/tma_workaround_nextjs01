To attract crypto enthusiasts and integrate Web 3 wallet functionality, you can build a game narrative and mechanics that appeal to the Web3 community, especially focusing on the concepts of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and in-game token rewards. Below is a suggestion for a **game story** and a plan for **integrating Web3 wallets**.

### Game Story: "Planet CryptoQuest"

#### Concept
"Planet CryptoQuest" is an adventure where players become explorers of an undiscovered planet filled with rare cryptographic treasures, virtual assets, and resources represented as NFTs. These resources can be claimed, traded, and exchanged for in-game tokens, which players can later withdraw to their connected Web3 wallets. Each expedition offers unique, cryptographically generated assets that can appreciate in value.

Players need to make strategic choices, including mining for tokens, battling other explorers, and securing resources while ensuring they don't lose it to other players. The game incorporates elements of exploration, staking, and DeFi mechanics, where players can use their crypto assets in the game world.

#### Game Mechanics
1. **Exploration**: Players explore the vast, uncharted planet to mine for tokens and discover rare NFT artifacts.
2. **Mining for Tokens**: In certain areas, players can use their mining equipment (which could also be an NFT) to extract a cryptocurrency-like in-game token.
3. **PvP Battles**: Players can choose to battle other explorers to secure their mined resources. The winner takes the resources of the defeated player.
4. **Staking and Rewards**: Players can stake their earned tokens to receive passive rewards over time (aligned with crypto staking principles).
5. **NFT Collection**: Rare items found in the game will be tradable as NFTs, giving each player a unique collection of assets.
6. **In-game Tokenomics**: In-game tokens can be traded, used for in-game purchases, or exchanged for real-world cryptocurrency, depending on player progression.

### Web3 Wallet Integration

1. **Install Web3 Libraries**: First, install a Web3 wallet integration library such as **ethers.js** or **web3.js** to interact with Ethereum-based wallets like **MetaMask** or other wallet providers.

```bash
npm install ethers
```

2. **Connect Web3 Wallet to the Game**: Modify your `src/app/page.tsx` to include a Web3 wallet connection feature. For simplicity, we’ll integrate MetaMask. The user connects their wallet to the game, and we retrieve their wallet address and display it in the game.

#### Code to Connect Web3 Wallet

```tsx
// src/app/page.tsx
"use client";

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

export default function Home() {
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);
  const [walletAddress, setWalletAddress] = useState<string | null>(null);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setScore(score + 1);
  };

  const connectWallet = async () => {
    if (typeof window.ethereum !== 'undefined') {
      try {
        const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
        await provider.send("eth_requestAccounts", []);
        const signer = provider.getSigner();
        const address = await signer.getAddress();
        setWalletAddress(address);
      } catch (err) {
        setError('Could not connect to wallet');
      }
    } else {
      setError('MetaMask is not installed');
    }
  };

  return (
    <div style={{ textAlign: 'center', marginTop: '50px' }}>
      <h1>Planet CryptoQuest</h1>
      {walletAddress ? (
        <>
          <p>Welcome, explorer: {walletAddress}</p>
          <p>Your Score: {score}</p>
          <button onClick={handleClick} style={{ padding: '10px', fontSize: '18px' }}>
            Click Me!
          </button>
        </>
      ) : (
        <>
          <button onClick={connectWallet} style={{ padding: '10px', fontSize: '18px' }}>
            Connect Web3 Wallet
          </button>
          {error && <p style={{ color: 'red' }}>{error}</p>}
        </>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **Connect Wallet**: The game prompts the player to connect their Web3 wallet via MetaMask (or another wallet service).
2. **Gameplay**: Players explore, mine, and earn in-game tokens as rewards for completing quests and challenges.
3. **Rewards and Staking**: Players can stake their in-game tokens to receive periodic rewards, following a staking model similar to DeFi applications.
4. **NFT Marketplace**: Players can buy and sell NFTs representing rare in-game items or land plots (representing mining areas).
5. **Withdrawal**: Players can withdraw their in-game tokens to their connected Web3 wallet, allowing them to use or trade them on the blockchain.

### Step 4: Deploying Your Next.js App with Web3

Deploy your game using **Vercel** or any platform with HTTPS support, following the same steps you’ve used for deployment before.

Once deployed, you can integrate your **TON Wallet** or other crypto wallets following the same pattern as the MetaMask integration.

### Monetization and Crypto Appeal

1. **Tokenomics**: Incorporate your in-game tokenomics where players can mine for tokens and stake them for additional rewards.
2. **DeFi**: Offer in-game decentralized finance features such as staking, lending, and borrowing of game tokens.
3. **NFT Marketplace**: Build an in-game NFT marketplace to trade rare assets like mining equipment, land, or avatars.
4. **DAO Governance**: Implement a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) model where players vote on game updates and future developments using their in-game tokens.
